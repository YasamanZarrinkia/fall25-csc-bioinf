"Explain the following repo with all the details to me, you need to translate to english"
"Explain the attached four .py files, what each function is trying to do"
"go through all the important parts here https://docs.exaloop.io/language/overview/ explain the highlights and the differences with python"
"go through all the important parts here https://docs.exaloop.io/language/overview/ then convert these 4 attached file to codon based on this link"
im gonna attach 4 python files and the content of 4 codon friendly code with you, they are suppose to do the same thing but im getting different results, the python results are correct but the codon ones are not”
“what do you mean by first file and second file, I don't want to change anything with the python files, just the codon friendly ones need a change”
“how do you know its not using the reverse compliment ?”
"(.venv) … `codon run main_codon.py data1` … error: cannot import name `setrecursionlimit` from `sys`**” *(error surfaced for fix)"
" utils_codon.py:6 (15-39): error: cannot import name 'join' from'os.path'"
"dbg_codon.py:64 (13-53): error:
    'Node\[Set\[int\],int,int,str,Optional\[int\],bool\]' does not match
    expected type"
"did you do all the following modification?** … *Unify k‑mer processing range; simplify edge construction; implement DFS depth; unify starting node selection; unify node management"
“how can I wipe the file in shsell”
“how can I make a new folder in the fall25/code and call it genome-assembly-codon then move all the -codon.py files into this folder and remove them from genome-assembly folder”
“how can I rename these files to not have the _codon in this new folder”
“dataset4 the python run did not produce the config file, also the n50s are different for codon and python but it should be the same”
“lets just try the docker, lets run the dataset4 on docker”
“can I do it for codon as well?”
“give me just for data4”
“how can I run dataset 4 now”
“this is not working”
“but its working correctly for other datasets”
“DEBUG: main start … exit=0” (you pasted debug output)
“how to rename the contig.fasta to contig_codon.fasta, theres already one file with this name I want to remove that before”
“Now write a script (say, week1/evaluate.sh…)”
“what's the difference between your code and this” (you pasted an alternate script)
“upgrade your code so it consider docker and other stuff”
“why should I ignore output files?”
“how can I create evaluate.sh?”
“how can I do all these Force Docker for Codon …”
“should I do USE_DOCKER_CODON=true … before running the script?”
“its returning none for the pythons, I test it before they were working”
“give me the updated script”
“how can I stop the docker?”
“so the thing is that the contig.fasta are empty, why can't I delete them?”
“my instructor is asking for the following layout in the repo but I don't know what he means by the test folder, I think he means to keep the contig files there, I might be wrong”
“can you give me the updated evaluate.sh I don't know if they want to see the outputs, can I keep them, then when they run the evaluate would it overwrite them?”
“since its in the repo, we can always recover the old files right?”
“ok there are some points that you have tp update …” (you described edits for the report)
“ok under dataset 4, I thought it could not be run locally at all is wron …”
“I think you can combine dataset 4 and the codon debbuging content under the codon debugging …”
“yes” (confirming regeneration of the report)
“I wanna add that we produce the N50”
“can you add the below as well in addition and regenerate the report” (you pasted the N50 section)
“can I add ps: AI helped me to draft this report in the bottom of the report?”
“please provide a history of my prompts that helped me to do this project”
“give me option 2”
